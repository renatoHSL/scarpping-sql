Scraping music tours

This project is a web scraping tool that extracts specific data fields from a target website, processes the information, and saves it in a .db table. The tool is designed to pull only new information, avoiding duplicate entries, and consistently updates the database with relevant data. Each data field is organized into columns within a spreadsheet, clearly labeled for easy analysis. This automated process streamlines data collection, ensuring up-to-date, unique information for each field in the output file.
